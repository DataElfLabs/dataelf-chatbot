## **💡 Getting Started**  

### **1️⃣ Fork & Clone the Repository**

## **📌 Contribution Workflow**  

### **3️⃣ Create a Branch**  
- Create a new branch for your contribution. This helps keep your work organized and separate from the main codebase  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch-name
   ```
- Use meaningful branch names:  
  - `feature-username-auth` (for a new feature)  
  - `fix-response-bug` (for a bug fix)  

### **4️⃣ Make Changes & Commit**  
- Follow clean **code formatting** (use Black for Python).  
- Write **clear commit messages**:  
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Added feature XYZ to chatbot"
   ```

### **5️⃣ Push & Submit a Pull Request (PR)**  
- Head over to original DatElf Chat repository at "The Shire" and open a Pull Request (PR). Our maintainers will review your work.  
- 👓 Your PR will undergo  review and testing. The maintainers will provide feedback, and you can collaborate to make your contribution even better. We value teamwork!
